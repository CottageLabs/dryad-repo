   <h1>Become a member</h1>
   <p>Dryad is governed by a nonprofit membership organization of the same name. Membership is open
   to any stakeholder organization, including but not limited to journals, scientific societies,
   publishers, research institutions, libraries, and funding organizations. Members have a say in
   the governance of the organization through election of its Board of Directors and amendments to
   its Bylaws; receive discounts on deposit fees; participate in an active knowledge sharing
   network; and help advance the mission of the organization through their financial support. An
   annual meeting and conference allows members to stay informed about new innovations in the
   scholarly communication of research data and to help direct the future of the organization.</p>
   <p>Annual membership fees are:</p>
   <ul class="text-list">
    <li>$1,000 for organizations with budgets less than $10 million/year</li>
    <li>$5,000 for organizations with budgets above $10 million/year</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Charter members have the option of deferring membership fees until January 2016; see the list
   of charter members at <a href="/members">http://datadryad.org/members</a>.</p>
